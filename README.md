# Phase-3-Project
Customer Churn Prediction for SyriaTel

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for SyriaTel, a telecommunications company, to forecast customer churn. Customer churn, where customers cease using the company’s services, is a significant issue impacting revenue and growth. By identifying which customers are likely to churn, SyriaTel can implement targeted strategies to improve retention and customer satisfaction.

# Business Problem
SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications company, aims to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss caused by customer churn. Churn occurs when customers stop using the company’s services, and it is crucial for SyriaTel to predict which customers are likely to churn soon. By identifying these customers in advance, SyriaTel can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

# Objectives
Develop Predictive Models: Create models to predict customer churn using the provided dataset.

Analyze Customer Data: Examine customer demographics, usage patterns, and service interactions to identify churn predictors.

Provide Actionable Insights: Offer insights and recommendations based on the model's findings to aid SyriaTel in reducing churn.
Dataset
The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, usage patterns, and service interactions. Key features include:


# Methodology
Data Understanding and Preparation

Loaded and explored the dataset.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Performed feature engineering and selection.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions and relationships between features using visualizations.
Identified key predictors of churn.

# Model Development

Developed multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

# Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Selected the best-performing model based on a balance of these metrics.

# Results

Logistic Regression: Baseline model with decent performance but affected by class imbalance.

Decision Tree: Improved balance between precision and recall, but prone to overfitting.

KNN: High accuracy, but showed signs of overfitting and class imbalance handling issues.

# Recommendations

Implement techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the classes in the dataset.
 
Model Ensemble: Combine multiple models (e.g., using stacking or voting classifiers) to leverage their individual strengths.

Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques to segment customers and apply targeted retention strategies for different segments.

Develop a loyalty program that offers benefits like discounts, priority service, or exclusive offers for long-term customers.
 
Use CRM (Customer Relationship Management) tools to track customer history and preferences. Reduce the number of calls to customer service by providing customers with self-service tools.

# Next Steps

Deployment: Develop a deployment pipeline for real-time churn prediction.

Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor and update the model.

A/B Testing: Implement A/B tests to measure retention strategies' effectiveness.

Customer Feedback: Incorporate customer feedback to refine the model.

Regular Updates: Schedule updates and retraining sessions to adapt to changing customer behavior.

# Conclusion

By following this approach, SyriaTel can accurately predict customer churn and implement effective strategies to improve customer retention, thereby reducing revenue loss and enhancing customer satisfaction.
